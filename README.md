How To Play:

Use the keyboard to control the robot arm. There are five pivots on the arm, and each pivot has full rotational freedom. Controls for each pivot come in sets of six keys.
Pivot 1 (closest to base): QW (x-axis) | AS (y-axis) | ZX (z-axis)
Pivot 2: ER | DF | CV 
Pivot 3: TY | GH | BN 
Pivot 4: UI | JK | M,
Pivot 5: OP | L; | ./

The camera views can be changed by using the Left/Right arrow keys.
